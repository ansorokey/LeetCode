I literally cannot grasp what this problem is asking me to do. Okay, that's a lie, I actually can. But I dot understand the way it is worded. So here's what I'm gonna do. I'm just going to use a DFS to count the number of cardinlly adjacent "cities"

Ths means I want to track a global count variable starting at 0.

Then, I want to iterate through the entire matrix (nested loop) and lok at each city. When we encounter a city, we want to check if it's already in a province we counted, or rather in a collection of visited cities. If it isnt, we've started a new province. From here, we want to branch to each adjacent neighbor and add them to the current province. We only want to add neigbors that haven't already been visited.
This should be done recursively for each cardinal direction.

After we have added every city in a province, we incrememnt the count and continue through the matrix. If we come across a city n the same province, we do not need to do anything. When we come across a new city not in the visited cities, we start the process again.

When the matrix is complete, return the count.
