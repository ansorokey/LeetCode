Hi, my name is Anton. I've spent the majority of my time in the workforce doing manual labor and physically demanding jobs - which I have loved. I enjoy the exercise, the fast paced environmet, and being able to knock out some work while listening to podcasts or music. I used to work two jobs, or pull a lot of overtime to make ends meet. I'm currently fortunate enough to hold a position that keeps me financially stable and allows for a wonderful work life balance. With more freeetime, I've been able to think more about what I want out of a career and what to do with my time. Moving forward, I'd like a career that challenges me mentally, pushes me to think differently, and gives me the opportunity to develop AND apply new skills. And the world of tech seemed like the perfect fit. Software development specifically appealed to me the most because it's such an accessible field and so many differerent people from so many different backgrounds can come together to provide unique perspectives and create innovative solutions.
